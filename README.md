# Pok√©Discoverer

This project was created as my first proper foray into learning React. It randomly generates a pokemon ID number and then uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display information about that pokemon back to the user.

## Tech details

- Created using create-react-app
- Written in Typescript with typing used throughout
- Uses async/await functions to call [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- Has a sample pokemon (Pikachu) stored in a json file for use should the API call fail
- Auto-deploys to Github Pages using a yaml CI/CD action whenever changes are made to the master branch
- Includes some basic Jest testing
- Styled using SCSS
- Search textbox/dropdown is aided by the [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/) autocomplete component
